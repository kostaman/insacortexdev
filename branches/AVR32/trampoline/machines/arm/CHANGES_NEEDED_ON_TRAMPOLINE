* core services (after dispatch in system calls) does not return anything in the prototypes. Actually, we need to know if a context switch is required or not

* changes needed on GOIL (see in simtec directory and Make-rules template)

* There is some values we need to use in assembler files (NEED_CONTEXT_SWITCH value, OS_SYSCALL_COUNT, size of some types, ...)

* locking depth may be redondant with autosar one

* OS393 : GOIL shall generate a macro for converting counters ticks to physical time
