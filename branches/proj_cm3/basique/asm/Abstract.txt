The 'Blinky' project is a simple program for the STM32F103RBT6 
using Keil 'MCBSTM32' Evaluation Board and demonstrating 
interrupt functionality.

Example functionality:                                                   
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL    =            8.00 MHz
   - SYSCLK  =           72.00 MHz
   - HCLK    = SYSCLK  = 72.00 MHz
   - PCLK1   = HCLK/2  = 36.00 MHz
   - PCLK2   = HCLK    = 72.00 MHz
   - ADCLK   = PCLK2/6 = 12.00 MHz
   - SYSTICK = HCLK/8  =  9.00 MHz

 - LED blink with speed depending on potentiometer position
   - Sys Timer is used in interrupt mode
 - character LCD displays init message and bargraph 
   depending on potentiometer position
 - AD value is output onto serial port USART1 
   USART1 settings: 115200 baud, 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit
 - AD is used with DMA
   AD settings: 12 bit resolution
 
The Blinky program is available in different targets:
  Simulator:      configured for software Simulator
  MCBSTM32:       runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                  (used for production or target debugging)
  MCBSTM32 + OPT: MCBSTM32 with Flash Options
                  (used for programming)
